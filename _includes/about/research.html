  I am broadly interested in distributed systems, machine learning and cloud computing.
  Currently, I aim to answer the following questions:

 <ul>
  <li>Can task and model parallelism be effectively combined to parallelize ML models?</li>
  <li>How to schedule such operations across distributed workers?</li>
  <li>Can advancements in serverless computing further scale these models?</li>
 </ul>
