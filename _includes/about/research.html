  <h3>Research Areas</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>Machine Learning Systems</li>
  	<li>Distributed Systems</li>
  	<li>Cloud</li>
  	<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research Goals</h3>
  I am currently reading research in the intersection of Systems, ML and the Cloud to help me answer the following questions:
  
  <ul>
   <li>Can task and model parallelism be effectively combined to parallelize ML models?</li>
   <li>How to schedule such operations across distributed workers?</li>
   <li>Can advancements in serverless computing further scale these models?</li>
  </ul>

  I plan to apply for a Masters in CS with a concentration in Systems and Machine Learning to help me in the above effort. <br> <br>
