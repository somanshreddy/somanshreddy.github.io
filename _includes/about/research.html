  <h3>Current work</h3>
  I am working with <a href="https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/krishnamoorthi-makkithaya.html">Professor Krishnamoorthi Makkithaya</a> and <a href="https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/dinesh-acharya-u.html">Professor Dinesh Acharya U</a> on Topic Modelling. Our work identifies latent topics within Amazon phone reviews to assess why certain companies consistently dominate the smartphone market.

  <h3>Future work</h3>
  I am reading research in Systems, ML and the Cloud to help me answer the following questions:
  
  <ul>
   <li>Can task and model parallelism be effectively combined to parallelize ML models?</li>
   <li>How to schedule such operations across distributed workers?</li>
   <li>Can advancements in serverless computing further scale these models?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I plan to apply for a Master's in CS with a concentration in Systems to help me answer the above questions. You can read more about my motivation to pursue a Master's <a href="/blog/masters-motivation">here</a>. </p>
