# **About Me :wave:**

I am currently a backend software developer at Komprise. I will be applying for a Master's in Computer Science in the US for Fall 2022.

My research interests include distributed systems, machine learning and cloud computing. In particular, I am interested in solving Systems problems associated with learning and deploying machine learning models at scale.
