# **About Me :wave:**

My name is Somansh Reddy Satish. I am a senior software engineer at Komprise in Bangalore, India. I am broadly interested in Distributed Systems, Systems for Machine Learning and the Cloud.

I have majored in Computer Science with a minor in Intelligent Systems at Manipal Institute of Technology (BTech). I have applied for a Master's in Computer Science in the US for Fall 2022. Currently, I am awaiting decisions.

I have recently developed an interest in learning (and using) new words to <strike>bamboozle</strike> edify my friends. For this, I would like to give credit to the GRE for being more than just another exam.

Outside of work, you would find me watching anime, cricket and basketball. I also enjoy reading a lot about investing because I like watching numbers grow. #CompoundInterest
