# **About Me :wave:**

My name is Somansh Reddy Satish. I am a backend software development engineer at Komprise. I am broadly interested in Distributed Systems, Systems for Machine Learning and the Cloud.

I have majored in Computer Science with a minor in Intelligent Systems at Manipal Institute of Technology (BTech). Currently I am applying for a Master's in Computer Science in the US for Fall 2022.

I have recently developed an interest in learning (and using) new words to <strike>bamboozle</strike> edify my friends. For this, I would like to give credit to the GRE for being more than just another exam. Outside of work, you would find me watching anime, cricket and basketball.
