description: A brief summary of my motivation to pursue a Master's in Computer Science.
---
  <p>I noticed that many complex problems in the industry are often solved by research. I believe that a more rigorous and systematic approach to research would help me in the industry. I have also read many interesting papers this year that involve Systems + X, where X is any other field. Among the papers I enjoyed reading, the X was usually Machine Learning, or the Cloud, or even both. I'll admit that there have been a few instances where I was amazed and stopped to think, "I really want to work on this!".</p>

  <p> Many of the Systems research labs at the top graduate schools have been publishing research where systems influence machine learning and vice versa. I believe that working in such labs and learning from top researchers would significantly help me in the industry. Furthermore, it would help me make progress in answering the research questions that I am interested in. Hence, I would like to pursue a Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Systems.</p>

  <p> I am currently reading research in the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems. For this, I found papers at conferences like MLSys to be a good start. I would like to build the foundation required to contribute to research labs at graduate school.</p>
