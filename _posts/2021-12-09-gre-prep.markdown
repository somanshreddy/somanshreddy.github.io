## My experience

There are a plethora of detailed guides available online on how to study for the GRE. I would recommend that you check out some Reddit posts by top scorers. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy hence I recommended reading a few different test-prep experiences.

The goals of this exercise is given below:

<ul>
	<li>List the resources that you require for your exam preparation.</li>
	<li>Analyze the common mistakes that test-takers make.</li>
	<li>Identify the patterns in the practices followed by top scorers.</li>
</ul>

As for this blog post, I will address each of the above points based on my experience. Before that, let's start with a precursor.

### Part 0: Before you start

<ol>
	<li>Create an ETS GRE account</li>
	<li>Familiarize yourself with the test pattern, i.e, the test duration, the number of sections and the number of questions in each section</li>
</ol>

### Part 1: Resources

<ol>
	<li>Official ETS guides - Ironically, THE best test material yet the most often overlooked</li>
	<li>For Verbal, the test taking strategies outlines in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktwzce9ncy_K78l1KBZkYQ">GregMat's YouTube channel</a> are excellent!</li>
