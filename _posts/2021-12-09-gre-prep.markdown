## My experience

There are a plethora of detailed guides available online on how to study for the GRE. I would recommend that you check out some Reddit posts by top scorers. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy hence I recommended reading a few different test-prep experiences.

The goals of this exercise is given below:

<ul>
	<li>List the resources that you require for your exam preparation.</li>
	<li>Analyze the common mistakes that test-takers make.</li>
	<li>Identify the patterns in the practices followed by top scorers.</li>
</ul>

As for this blog post, I will address each of the above points based on my experience. Before that, let's start with a precursor.

### Part 0: Before you start

<ol>
	<li>Create an ETS GRE account</li>
	<li>Familiarize yourself with the test pattern, i.e, the test duration, the number of sections and the number of questions in each section</li>
</ol>

### Part 1: Resources

<ol>
	<li>Official ETS guides - Ironically, THE best test material yet the most often overlooked</li>
	<li>For Verbal, the test taking strategies outlines in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktwzce9ncy_K78l1KBZkYQ">GregMat's YouTube channel</a> are excellent!</li>
</ol>

### Part 2: Mistakes

<ul>
	<li>Focusing solely on third party test preparation material because you paid the big bucks for it. As GregMat stresses in many of his videos, the ETS material is the real deal. Hence, it most closely resembles the actual test - in particular, the subtle ways in which the GRE answer choices trick you.</li>
	<li>Not reviewing enough. Do not focus on solving as many questions as you can. You need to focus on analyzing your mistakes and trying to identify patterns.</li>
</ul>

### Part 3: Patterns

<ul>
	<li>Maintaining an error log for Quant. This is essentially a list of the mistakes that you have made. This should not contain any specific questions that you have answered incorrectly. It works at a higher level of abstraction - the concept. For example, not considering negative numbers, not taking 2 as a prime, etc are perfect candidates for the error log.</li>
</ul>
