### List of books

The below list is ordered according to the impact that that these have had in my (short) software development career so far.

| :-------------:|:-------------:| :---------:| :----------:|
| Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship    | Robert C. Martin | Clean Code | A MUST read for every programmer. Although the code samples are in Java, the principles are universal. | 5.5/5 |
|     Effective Java     |  Joshua Bloch |  Java | You cannot call yourself a true Java programmer if you haven't read this book. <br> **Caution**: Intermediate level | 5/5 |
|Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide: A Distributed Real-Time Search and Analytics Engine| Clinton Gormley and Zachary Tong | Search Engine | Although this book was written for a much older version of ElasticSearch, the concepts underlying such a search enginer makes this book a great read for anyone who wants to work on search engines or even distribited systems. | 4.5/5 |
| Java The Complete Reference     | Herbert Schildt      | Java | A great primer for Java    | 4/5 |
| Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit     | Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas, and Jeff Langr      | Java | A good read for those who are writing a unit test for the first time.  | 4/5 |
